           Cotton:
     Cotton is a very popular material, used by many designers to design clothes. Due to its popularity, it is important that we are using this material in the correct way by ensuring that we do our part by recycling which means that this recycled cotton can be reused for a better cause. To grow Cotton, we may require a lot of pesticides (substance which can destroy insects or other organisms) hence this can negatively impact our surroundings and us as they are toxic, leading to many deteriorated health conditions. 
     As an alternative, most brands use organic cotton which is more sustainable that the original cotton used in the past. Organic cotton reduces the negative impact of cotton on the environment by removing harmful pesticides which can have a harmful impact. 
     Some brands also use recycled / upcycled cotton which is a more sustainable option compared to conventional and organic cotton as it also helps reduce energy and water consumption and reduces the amount of cotton clothes in landfill.

     Linen: 
     Linen is a popular fabric and is used by many countries widely because it is THAT good! Linen grows in poor quality soil which means we do not waste any soil or plant for the creation of this fabric and involves less pesticides. It is also fully biodegradable which makes it better for our planet. Linen is also very breathable and absorbent which is why it is considered one of the cleanest fabrics. 
     However, you may find that you are paying extra for the price since linen is rarer as it is inelastic meaning that during production, it can easily break down. However, be rest assured because it is worth it for us, the environment and planet.

     Polyester: 
     Polyester requires large amounts of water for cooling and releases harmful chemicals, for example, phthalates because it has shown health issues. Polyester production also requires a lot of energy which can impact greenhouse gasses which is why itâ€™s environmentally not beneficial. Polyester is also not suitable as it can melt very easily hence causing it to be dangerous if there are high iron settings. Any fossil fuel item is not suitable in the long term as it is not biodegradable either. Unlike Linen, polyester is known to lack breathability and moisture absorption which means that it can also negatively impact people too. Is it worth sacrificing our planet?
